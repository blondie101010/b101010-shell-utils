# b101010-shell-utils

Shell scripting utilities

These are meant to simplify recurring shell scripting tasks and to normalize service control over various operating systems.

## Installation

A simple and the only supported way to install it is with the following command:

    bash <(curl -L -Ss https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blondie101010/b101010-shell-utils/master/install.sh)

## Status

This package is now considered in beta testing phase, but should still not be used for production yet until further testing is done!

Basic shell functions and service control have been fairly well tested on Gentoo, CentOS 6 & 7, and Ubuntu 14.04 so far.

System agnostic installer is a long term development option that will evolve as packages are added based on other project requirements.
