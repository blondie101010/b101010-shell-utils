Shell scripting utilities

These are meant to simplify recurring shell scripting tasks and to normalize service control over various operating systems.

## installation

It is strongly suggested to place these files in `/usr/local/lib` so that any script that uses them as dependencies can rely on their consistent position.

## status

This package is currently in testing phase and is not ready for production yet!

That said, so far it work well on most CentOS, Gentoo, and Ubuntu systems tested.
