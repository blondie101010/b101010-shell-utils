# b101010-shell-utils

Shell scripting utilities

These are meant to simplify recurring shell scripting tasks and to normalize service control over various operating systems.

## Installation

It is strongly suggested to place these files in `/usr/local/lib` so that any script that uses them as dependencies can rely on their consistent position.

A simple way to install it in a single command is:

    bash <(curl -L -Ss https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blondie101010/b101010-shell-utils/master/install.sh)

## Status

This package is currently in testing phase and is not ready for production yet!

That said, so far it works well on most CentOS, Gentoo, and Ubuntu systems tested.
